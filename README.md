# ProximityCalculatorApplication

This project acts as an API with just one endpoint. When called, the API will return all users who are from London or are within 50 miles of it.

The commit history is not too great as I had to restart the project the couple of times. The first time I was having issues with the JARs
I was using so switched to a gradle project. Then I realised that I needed to switch my project to a spring project once I got to the part 
of writing the endpoints.

The project has a few unit tests, and I did some testing on postman.
